# ML
-The Assignment is divided into tasks, each task can run independtly by itslef. There is no main file as I saw no need for it in this case
-The machine used is python on Google Colab
-the path of the files I used was to my goodle drive "'/content/drive/MyDrive/Master/Machine Learning/Assignment1/Classification Stream_Qlty/bitrate_train.csv'"
as they are stored there. To avoid casulaties, I modified it to make it ready to read the files from directory
I removed the pip command of the pandas profiling realted to colab to avoid useless commands. If there are any troubles here it is : "! pip install https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/archive/master.zip"
